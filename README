JavaScript based image frame player manual controls for use in web browser. This is useful, for example, for visualizing 
frame by frame output from a video or an iterative output. The player works by pre-loading all the image frames to local cache  
and then displays them in sequence at the indicated speed.

======= Installation =========

Download all files and launch image_player_sample.html in a web browser to operate the frame player with the included 
sample images.


======= Using image frames =========

First, one must generate image frames. See the sample images/ directory 
for an example. Frames must be the same size to play 
smoothly. There are multiple ways to generate such frames, for example, 
to save an image during every iteration (or 10 iterations) of an iterative 
algorithm or with ffmpeg or mencoder from a video file:
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -r 29.97 -q:v 1 -quality 98% images/output_%04d.jpg

After the image frames are generated, one must make an html file like 
image_player_sample.html which references the location of the image files. 

<input type="hidden" id="slideshow_image_path_js" name="slideshow_image_path" value="images/" />
Other options, like the default speed can also be set this way in the html file.
